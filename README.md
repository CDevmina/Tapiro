## 6. Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1 Category Mapping

When receiving raw categories from external sources:

1. First attempt exact matching with subcategory names
2. If no exact match, use text similarity to find the closest category
3. Default to the main category if no close subcategory match
4. Use "other" (within the appropriate main category) as fallback

### 6.2 Extraction Rules

For **purchase data**:

- Category should be mapped to the taxonomy
- Price should be classified into appropriate range
- Extract explicit attributes like color, brand when available

For **search data**:

- Analyze search terms to extract category information
- Identify qualifiers (like "cheap" â†’ budget price range)
- Extract color, material, or other attribute terms

### 6.3 Preference Calculation

When calculating user preferences:

1. Apply a decay factor to existing preferences (e.g., 0.8)
2. Add new data with normalized importance scores
3. Keep scores bounded between 0.0 and 1.0
4. Calculate attribute preferences separately for each category
